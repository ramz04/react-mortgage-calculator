            <br />
            The Bank’s rights under this agreement are cumulative, may be
            exercised as often as the Bank considers appropriate and are in

            (whether arising under this agreement or under the general law) will
            not be capable of being waived or varied, otherwise than by an
            express waiver or variation in writing. Any failure by the Bank to
            exercise, or any delay in exercising, any of such rights will not
            operate as a waiver or variation of that or any other such right;
            any defective or partial exercise of any such right will not
            preclude any other or further exercise of that or any other such
            rights; and no act or course of conduct or negotiation on the part
            of the Bank shall preclude the Bank from exercising any such right
            or constitute a suspension or any variation of such right.

            immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim and
            free and clear of any deduction or withholding on account of tax or
            otherwise. If the borrower is required by law to make any deduction
            or withholding from any payment under the Loan, the sum due from the
            borrower in respect of such payment shall be increased to the extent
            necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or
            withholding, the Bank receives a net sum equal to the sum which it
            would have received had no such deduction or withholding been
            required.

            production, be prima facie proof of the content of such certificate.

            <strong>5 Notices</strong>
            <br />

            be, will accept delivery of legal notices “(“the notice address”).
            Should either party wish to change its/his/her notice address, the
            other party must be notified in writing, and this notice must be
            hand delivered or sent by registered post. All other notices or
            communications required or permitted to be given in respect of the
            provisions of this agreement will be valid only if in writing and

            provided in the agreement or any changed address advised in terms of
            this clause, provided that any documents to be delivered in respect

            served on the parties’ notice address Any notice: (i) sent by
            prepaid registered post will be deemed to have been received on the

            business day after the date it was sent. Notwithstanding anything to
            the contrary contained herein, a written notice or communication
            actually received by either party will be an adequate written notice
            or communication to that party even though it was not sent to or
            delivered to your notice, postal or e-mail address or telefax
            number.

            present, future, actual, contingent, primary, collateral, joint or
            several and the borrower expressly waives any rights of set-off that
            the borrower may have, so far as is permitted by law, in respect of
            any claim which it may now or at any time hereafter have against the

            <strong>7 Severability</strong>
            <br />
            Each provision of the agreement is severable, the one from the other
            and, if at any time any provision is or becomes or is found to be
            illegal, invalid, defective or unenforceable for any reason by any
            competent court, the remaining provisions shall be of full force and
            effect and shall continue to be of full force and effect.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
            <strong>8 Currency Clauses</strong>
            <br />
            If any part of the Loan is denominated in a foreign currency ("the
            <strong> currency of the account"</strong>), payment under or the
            repayment of such Loan will be made in such foreign currency. Any
            money received by the Bank, or by any person appointed by the Bank,
            in a currency other than the currency of the account may be
            converted by the Bank into the currency of the account or such other
            currency as the Bank considers necessary to cover the obligations or
            liabilities of the borrower. The Bank shall use the Bank’s spot rate
            of exchange for such conversion. In the event of any legislation or
            extreme change in market conditions affecting the ability of the
            Bank to provide or fund loan in foreign currency, the Bank reserves
            the right, at its sole discretion, to switch any foreign currency
            indebtedness by the borrower into the local currency of Ghana at the
            rate ruling on the day of such switch. Also, in the event that the
            Bank demands repayment of any indebtedness of the borrower, after
            such demand has been made, the Bank reserves the right, at its sole
            discretion, to switch any foreign currency indebtedness by the
            borrower into the local currency of Ghana at the Bank’s spot rate
            ruling at the day of such switch. In exercising the aforementioned
            rights to switch foreign currency indebtedness into the local
            currency of Ghana, the Banks will not be liable for any losses
            resulting from exchange rate fluctuations.

          <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
            <strong>9 Assignment</strong>
            <br />
            The borrower shall not be entitled to assign all or any part of
            his/her obligations or benefits under this agreement without the
            prior written consent of the Bank, which consent will not be
            unreasonably withheld. The Bank shall be entitled, without the
            consent of or notice to the borrower, to cede, assign and/or
            delegate all or any part of its rights and/or obligations under the
            agreement and/or the Security, either absolutely or as collateral
            security, to any person (even though that cession, assignment and/or
            delegation may result in a splitting of claims against the
            borrower). Even if the Loan and/or Security is sold or ceded, the
            borrower acknowledges that the servicing and/or administration of
            such Loan and/or Security may: <br />
            9.1 still be performed by the Bank on behalf of the
            purchaser/cessionary or cedent; or <br />
            9.2 be contractually managed by a third party on behalf of the
            purchaser/cessionary or cedent; or <br />
            9.3 be performed by the purchaser/cessionary or cedent itself. These
            services and administrations can include the giving of notices,
            realisation of any collateral and the recovery of amounts due under
            the loan agreement. Even if the Loan (or any part thereof) is sold,
            ceded, assigned and/or delegated to any person ("the transferee"),
            the borrower acknowledges that the Bank may elect not to cede,
            assign or sell its rights under the Security and/or any other
            collateral ("relevant collateral") to the transferee such that,
            notwithstanding the sale, cession, assignment and/or delegation of
            the Loan (or any part thereof) to the transferee, the relevant
            collateral shall, as between the Bank (or its successors in title or
            assigns under the relevant collateral) and the borrower, continue to
            cover the indebtedness of the borrower to the Bank (or its
            successors in title or assigns under the relevant collateral) on the
            terms set out in the relevant Security documents.

            <strong>10 Material Adverse Change</strong>
            <br />
            In the event that a Material Adverse Change has occurred in the
            financial conditions, results of operations or business of the
            borrower, the Bank reserves the right to convert the Loan to a loan
            repayable on demand or to call for cash cover for the full extent of
            the borrower's indebtedness to the Bank, inclusive of contingent
            liabilities. “Material Adverse Change” shall mean a material adverse
            change in the Bank’s opinion and agreed by the borrower. If the
            borrower should not agree within 14 days of being notified by the
            Bank that a Material Adverse Change has taken place, then the matter
            shall be referred to the Bank’s auditors for their opinion and the
            borrower agrees that the opinion of the Bank’s auditors shall be
            final and binding.

            The borrower represents and warrants to the Bank that: <br />
            11.1 this agreement and the Security, when executed, will constitute
            legal, valid and binding obligations or those of the provider
